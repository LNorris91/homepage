This Homepage project is the last project for advanced HTML and CSS on the Odin Project.

It's a mock portfolio site primarily meant to showcase the flexibilty
of the pages layout, not the portfolio content.

the page should reformat it's layout based on two breakpoints resulting in
three different iterations. One for desktop, another for tablet and another
for mobile display.
